# This was the final project for DS3000: Foundations of Data Science

This was a group project, and I was responsible for constructing the machine learning models. Since other group members did not have Python experience, we wanted for each member to play to their strengths.  Therefore, as others did research and created the project proposals, posters, and slides, I was excited to handle machine learning tasks.

To get an overview of the project, check out the project poster!

To see my code, check out the jupyter notebook!
