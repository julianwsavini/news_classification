# This was the final project for DS3000: Foundations of Data Science

This was a group project, and I was responsible for constructing the machine learning models. Since others had not had any experience in Python, we wanted to play to our strengths, so as others were doing research and creating the project proposals, posters, and slides, I was very excited to perform machine learning.

To get an overview of the project, check out the project poster!

To see my code, check out the jupyter notebook!
